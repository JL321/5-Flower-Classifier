# Some Additional Notes

This classifier is based off of the following flower recognition dataset on Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition

Preprocessing is included within the code, so as long as directories are appropriately set, and imports are properly installed, the program should run without any external aid.

The program achieves 60%+ accuracy on 10 epochs, and up to 90%+ on 25- if you have the time (or a good computer), feel free to train for longer!(Make sure not to overfit though)
